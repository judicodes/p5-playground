# p5-playground

In this repository, I play around with Creative Coding using p5.js.

Some of the examples are based on ideas from the book *Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with JavaScript in p5.js* by von Benedikt Gross, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni or from the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/). I can highly recommend both resources if you want to get started with p5.js. :sparkles:

## Setup

To see the examples, navigate into the respective subfolders and open the HTML file in your preferred browser. 

For a more advanced setup including Hot Reloading, launch a development local server e.g. via the Live Server extension for VS Code.

Some of the examples will automatically be generated; for others, you have to move your mouse around to generate and change the output.
